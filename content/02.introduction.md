# Evidence sythesis

Evidence synthesis (e.g., systematic review, systematic maps, meta-analysis) is rapidly becoming a mainstream set of scientific methods with particular relevance for policy and decision makers. Estimates from 2014 suggest that on MEDLINE alone there were 8000 systematic reviews indexed annually, this represented a three-fold increase over the previous decade at the time (@doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002028). 

## Objectives - introduce ecosystem of evidence synthesis packages and to highlight benefit of meta-package of packages in R for evidence synthesis (namely, rmetaverse)

* Host suite of packages for FOSS evidence synthesis conduct

* Focus on gap filling for needs-based tool design

* Compartmentalise tasks - costs are lower, more choices, costs of package breaking lower, risks of lost effort lower

* Interoperability for transparency, Open data, removing lock-in

## Early history of evidence synthesis packages in R

* Matt’s work on dependencies and earliest packages
* Build on CJ Lortie’s work

## Beyond meta-analysis

* metagear

* revtools

* litsearchr

## Community of practice

* ESH
* ESMARConf

## User Interfaces and R (how it works)

## Why meta-packages are useful (pipeline)

## Examples of non-synthesis packages relevant to synthesis

## rmetaverse history (started on CRAN, required package developer buy-in)

## BUT rapid development of field means GitHub versions are more up-to-date and comprehensive
SO our approach is GitHub collections (somewhat more like a task view but for a pipeline of packages)

## Current assessment (lucid chart)

## Future vision for rmetaverse

* How it would work

* How we can use it to fill gaps

* Interoperability - important section

* Policies etc.
