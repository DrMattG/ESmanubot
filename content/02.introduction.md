# Evidence sythesis

Evidence synthesis (e.g., systematic review, systematic maps, meta-analysis) is rapidly becoming a mainstream set of scientific methods with particular relevance for policy and decision makers. Estimates from 2014 suggest that on MEDLINE alone there were 8000 systematic reviews indexed annually, this represented a three-fold increase over the previous decade at the time (@doi.org/10.1371/journal.pmed.1002028).
